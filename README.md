# Striver DSA Sheet Pattern Solutions

Welcome to the **Striver DSA Sheet Pattern Solutions** repository! This repository provides solutions for the "Must Do Pattern Problems" from the [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/). These patterns are fundamental to understanding the basics of loops and building complex patterns using simple code.

## 🌟 What You Will Learn

- **Basics of loops**: Understand the different types of loops and their applications in pattern creation.
- **Pattern building techniques**: Step-by-step solutions to help you visualize and understand how different patterns are formed.
- **Structured learning**: The solutions are written in a single Jupyter Notebook file, making it easy to follow along and learn sequentially.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains all the solutions organized in a single file for ease of learning.
- **Patterns Covered**:
  - Right-angled triangles
  - Inverted pyramids
  - Diamond shapes
  - Hollow patterns
  - And many more!

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhruvrana8/StriverDSAPatterns.git
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Use any IDE like VS Code or Jupyter to open and run the notebook.
3. **Run the cells step-by-step** to learn how each pattern is constructed.

## 💡 Why Use This Repository?

- **Interactive Learning**: Learn by executing code and visualizing the patterns.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Great for beginners to get started with loops and pattern-based problems.
- **Single Jupyter Notebook**: All solutions are in one place, making it convenient to navigate and understand.
